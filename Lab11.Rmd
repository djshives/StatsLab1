```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
X <- c(1,4,3,2,5,4,3,6,7,8)
Y <- c(1,3,6,7,8,2,8,7,6,9)
```

An X and Y variable contain the above numbers.

A. Compute Pearson’s 𝑟 and report the associated p-value using the cor.test() function.

```{r}
cor.test(X, Y)
```

B. Use a permutation test to create a null-distribution, and report the p-value for getting the observed correlation or larger using your simulated null-distribution.

```{r}
null <- replicate(1000, cor(sample(X), sample(Y)))

length(null[null >= cor(X, Y)]) / 1000
```

Using the variables X and Y above, and assuming that the values could be re-ordered in any way, report the following:

A. the smallest possible sum of cross-products

```{r}
X_increasing <- X %>%
  sort()

Y_decreasing <- Y %>%
  sort(decreasing = TRUE)

sum(X_increasing * Y_decreasing)
```

B. the largest possible sum of cross-products

```{r}
X_increasing <- X %>%
  sort()

Y_increasing <- Y %>%
  sort()

sum(X_increasing * Y_increasing)
```
