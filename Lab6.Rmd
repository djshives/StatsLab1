I decided to try and write a class object with a bunch of functions for the object. I split the class (rand_test()) into four methods:

(One note â€” set the seed as the same for each method to share the sampling data across each.)

- rand_test_output$means(seed, data, permutations)

Produces a tibble with all sample groups, conditions, and means for each condition in each sample group.

- rand_test_output$diff_means(seed, data, permutations)

Produces a vector of difference in sample means between conditions per sample group.

- rand_test_output$hist_means(seed, data, permutations)

Produces a histogram of all of the difference in sample means.

- rand_test_output$prob_mean_diff(seed, data, permutations, observered_mean_difference)

Produces the probability/odds of obtaining the mean difference or larger set by the parameter "observed_mean_difference".

Given that we randomly sampled permutations of the data 1000 times and received a result of 0.002 for the probability of obtaining a mean difference of 2 (what was observed), it is likely that this difference was not produced by chance. That being said, however, considering that the sample size overall for the experiment is n = 39, it is still possible that the observed outcome could have been by chance.

If the observed mean difference was 0.5, I would believe strongly that the result was produced by chance rather than the experimental manipulation.

I was able to complete this lab with minimal assistance outside of Stack Overflow for some syntax questions (especially as relates to creating a class object and subsequent methods in R).
