No, linear regression should not be performed on the above data as the relationship is not linear. Points where x < 10 display a perfect negative linear relationship (slope = -1) while points where x > 10 display a perfect positive relationship (slope = 1). Because of this, performing linear regression would result in a line of best fit with a slope of ~0.0. To attain a better estimate, more complex regression methods could be used (e.g., segmented regression, polynomial regression).
