In the critical test trial, 16 of 21  infants (76.19%) chose the new block. This percentage was significantly different than chance â€” determined by using the two-tailed binomial test (p = `r round(binomial$p.value, digits = 2)`, 95% confidence interval = [52.83%, 91.78%], relative risk ratio = 1.52). No significant effect of gender on infants' choices was indicated by a chi-square test of independence ($\chi^2$ N = 21 = `r round(uncorrected_gender_chi_sq, digits = 2)`, p = `r round(gender_chi_sq_unc, digits = 2)`).
